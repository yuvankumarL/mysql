// initially AUTOCOMMIT is turned on 
// this will update every changes that we made in DB
// now what if you deleted the entire rows in the table mistakenly
// this will affect the system

//


// so now we are turnning off the AUTOCOMMIT
SET AUTOCOMMIT = OFF;

//
COMMIT;

// mistakenly deleting the entire rows
DELETE FROM employees;

SELECT * FROM employees;

--> the entire rows are deleted, but still it is not commited

// 
ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM employees;

--> now the deleted datas are retrived
